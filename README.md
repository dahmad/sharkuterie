# Sharkuterie

A charcuterie board is a platter of perserved foods chosen for their complementary flavors that is carefully presented in an aesthetically pleasing way.

A shark is an apex predator famous for its ability to chomp pieces from large prey.

Sharkuterie will be a web-app that can take an existing song, chop it up, and serve the pieces that can best be reassembled into a new song.

This is an addition to a series of toy projects to challenge me to learn new languages and frameworks.

For this project, I intend to target Clojure and ClojureScript. For front-end tests, I want to explore the tool etaoin.

### Requirements
* As a user I want to upload an mp3 file
* AAUIW to paste a link to a YouTube song in lieu of uploading an mp3
* AAUIW to see the progress of the algorithmic slicing that is happening on the backend
* AAUIW samples to be mapped to my computer keyboard 
* AAUIW to hear a sound when I press a key on my keyboard
* AAUIW visual indications when keys are pressed
* AAUIW the option to remove a sound I don't like which will be replaced by another sample
* AAUIW to change the parameters of the slicing algorithm and rerender the samples to be mapped to my keyboard
* AAUIW relevant information about samples to be visually indicated on the keys on the frontend (e.g. waveform, length, or some derived "score")
* AAUIW to export samples I like
* AAUIW to upload a new mp3 file or YouTube link
* AAUIW to toggle a metronome on or off
* AAUIW to change the tempo of the metronome
* AAUIW to toggle a selection of drum beats on or off
* AAUIW to change the tempo of the drum beats
* AAUIW a hint as to what an appropriate tempo may be
* AAUIW to apply audio effects to samples individually or en masse
* AAUIW highlight sounds I like to keep track of which keys to press
* AAUIW upload pre-sliced songs to circumvent slicing time 
* AAUIW select pre-sliced songs that are saved on the backend
* AAUIW a legend to explain keyboard shortcuts
* AAUIW to hear an intelligently selected arrangement of the samples that may sound good
* AAUIW to see which keys are being pressed in this automated arrangement so I can play them myself
* AAUIW to toggle a visualizer plug-in (NOTE: see Clojure library Quil)
* AAUIW shapes to render on screen on key press
* AAUIW to record a sequence of key presses
* AAUIW to hear back my recording of key presses
* AAUIW to export the recording of key presses
